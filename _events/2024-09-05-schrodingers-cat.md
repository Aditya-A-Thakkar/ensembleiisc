Talk on Condensed Matter and Quantum Information by Caltech's PhD student.

<!--more-->

## Abstract

Quantum mechanics has two kinds of dynamical processes â€” unitary evolution and measurement. It has recently been appreciated that quantum measurement can be used to prepare exotic states that cannot be prepared efficiently using unitary dynamics alone. I will give the simplest example of such a state and, in the process, introduce you to some modern ideas in quantum information and condensed matter, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking, long-range entanglement, and duality.

## Target Audience

This talk is aimed at anyone comfortable with elementary quantum mechanics (Hamiltonian, symmetry, ground state, etc) and reading the discussion of prerequisites (attached). The talk will be theoretical and will not discuss the actual preparation methods and quantum platforms in the lab.
