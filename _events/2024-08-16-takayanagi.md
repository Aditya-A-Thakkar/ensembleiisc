**Venue: Main Lecture Hall**
**Time: 5.30 PM, 17-August-2024**
 
The pioneer of Holographic Entanglement Entropy, Professor Tadashi Takayanagi from Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, is coming to IISc on 17th August 2024, Saturday to interact with the IISc student community, especially Undergraduates. It is an extremely special occasion because he received the prestigious **Dirac Medal of 2024** (one of the highest honours for Theorists) just a week ago for his revolutionary work with Shinsei Ryu that he did just as a young post-doctorate at Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UCSB. 
 
Come meet the legend, who opened a completely new door to Physics (see [Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu%E2%80%93Takayanagi_conjecture)), in real time. He will talk about his recent works in layman's terms and also interact with the students informally. This is literally a once-in-a-lifetime offer for all of those who are not going to be High Energy Theorists (just joking!)
