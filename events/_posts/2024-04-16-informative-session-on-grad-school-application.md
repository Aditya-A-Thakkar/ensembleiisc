Nisarg Chadha talks about grad school applications

<!--more-->

Join us for an informative session designed to guide you through the application process. This talk will equip you with the knowledge and strategies needed to craft a compelling application that stands out.

This will not only cover grad school (PhD) applications but also internship and masterâ€™s opportunities and applications.

This session is open to all undergraduate students considering graduate school applications, that is, the third and fourth-year students in particular. Students from all majors are invited.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain valuable insights and navigate the graduate school application process with confidence.


> [Nisarg's Notes]
the talk will mainly be focussed on PhD and Master's applications. Some general aspects like writing SoPs, preparing CV, etc. might come in handy for applying to internship programs but I won't be explicitly discussing internship programs.
