Beginning of The Kalpesh and the QT Focus Group

<!--more-->

We are thrilled to introduce the **Quantum Technology Focus Group**, a highly devoted group aimed at exploring the cutting-edge world of quantum techology and the theoretical framework it stands on.
We will attempt to understand the ongoing experimental research with the help of:

1. Lab Visits
2. Hands On Lab and Simulation Demos
3. Guest Lectures
4. Paper Presentations & Discussions

Initially we plan to focus on ***Quantum Computation*** and ***Superconducting Qubits***. As we progress we will delve into various other physical realisations of qubits (Photonics, Trapped Ion, Neutral Atoms, etc) and possibly cover far-reaching topics like Quantum Error Correction, Quantum Optomechanics, etc.
We will announce the talks and lectures regularly through Teams and WhatsApp.
