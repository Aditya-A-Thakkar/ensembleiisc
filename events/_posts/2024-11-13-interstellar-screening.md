Interstellar, lessgooo!

<!--more-->


As we come to the end of this semester, Ensemble hosts a very welcome session for all members (especially first years) - a movie screening.

This **Saturday, 16 Nov 2024, at 9:00 pm, in G01 OPB**, we will screen Interstellar. This is it.
Totally not a way to deliver some insight into the physics of time dilation.

Also, this is not the last session this year. Stay tuned for the ‘Noble Paper Presentations’ in December.
