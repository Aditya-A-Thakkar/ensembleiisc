Notification regarding ICTS Public Lecture.

<!--more-->

ICTS is organising a public lecture on The Many Body Physics of Computation on **15 January 2025 from 14:30 to 16:00 hrs** as a part of its series of talks and discussions "A Hundred Years of Quantum Mechanics".

The speaker of the talk, Vedika Khemani is an Associate Professor of physics at Stanford University. She is a theoretical physicist who works at the interface of quantum information and condensed matter physics. She received her Ph.D. from Princeton University in 2016, and was a Junior Fellow at Harvard from 2016-19. Khemani has received the Infosys Prize, the Breakthrough New Horizons in Physics Prize and the McMillan Award for her work on non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.
 
The lecture will primarily discuss how ideas from many-body physics have shaped the past, present, and future of computation: from the collective behaviour of electrons in semiconductors, to the spin-glass theory breakthroughs, like Hopfield neural networks, which laid the foundation for artificial intelligence and machine learning, to the importance of topological phases in enabling robust error correction for quantum processors.
 
The talk, being a public lecture, would cater to a large audience even from non-Physics backgrounds and hence should be quite graspable even by our first year UGs. This can be an excellent experience.
 
There're shuttle services available from IISc Main Gate to ICTS. Interested students can avail the same. Due to all three of us (Vinay, Simar and me) having 4th Semester labs during the time, we won't be able to accompany you for this journey, unfortunately. But anyone interested (and free, ofcourse!) must give this a chance. It should be worth your time.
