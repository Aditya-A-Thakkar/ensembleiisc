## Synopsis

After a refreshing December vacation, it's time to reignite the spark of quantum curiosity! We’re thrilled to kick-start this semester with the next installment in the Lectures on Quantum Technology series.

Join us as we delve in some fascinating quantum systems, solve their Hamiltonians, see their applications and understand why quantum is considered to be the next tech revolution.

### Details of the Session

**Speaker**: Kalpesh Bhatnagar (2nd Year UG)
**Date**: 23rd January (Thursday)
**Time**: 9:30 PM
**Venue**: G-01, OPB

### Topics to be Covered

- Controlling Qubits with Light - Rabi Oscillations, Lab Setup for cQED.
- Measuring the Qubit - Dispersive Readout
- The Transmon Qubit - Josephson Junctions
- Quantum Computing Application
- If time allows we will touch upon:
- Basic Quantum Optics - Field Quantization, Coherent & Squeezed States
- Squeezed Light in Gravitational Wave Detection

### Recommended Preparation

To make the most of this session, we encourage you to brush up on the following foundational topics:

- Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Solution (Operator Method)
- Interaction Picture

A brief recap will be done in the session. However, a quick review beforehand is highly recommended.

Come prepared, come curious, and let’s embark on another exciting quantum journey together!
See you all there!
