Microcanonical ensemble in the realm of classical statistical mechanics

<!--more-->

## Synopsis

This lecture further delves into the microcanonical ensemble, in the realm of classical statistical mechanics.

Through illustrative examples, such as the classical ideal gas, we'll explore the principles and applications of this ensemble.

If time allows, we'll also introduce the canonical ensemble, laying the groundwork for further exploration in subsequent lectures.
