## Synopsis

We've organized a talk on Linear Algebra today at 9 PM in G01, OPB, specifically aimed at freshers with no prerequisites required. The session will cover key topics such as vector spaces, linear transformations, diagonalization, vector calculus, and more, all with a physics-oriented approach.

Again, this will be very relevant for freshers interested in getting a headstart on some important machinery for doing physics for the next few semesters. So do join in!
