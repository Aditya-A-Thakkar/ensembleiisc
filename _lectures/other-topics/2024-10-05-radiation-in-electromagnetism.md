Follow up on yesterday's math lecture with a talk on radiation in electromagnetism

<!--more-->

## Synopsis

We kick-off the group with a talk on the postulates of quantum mechanics and an introduction to QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python). QuTiP is widely used by researcher around the world for simulating various quantum systems, designing control pulses for quantum computers, and studying noise. We will use the tool extensively in the focus group for various demos and projects.

## Pre-requisites

Classical Mechanics (as taught in Abhishek’s  lecture or above), Linear Algebra (as taught in Simar’s or above). Basic Quantum Mechanics will be covered in this talk to guide through the simulation. **Bring a laptop**.

## Target Audience

2nd and 3rd Year UG, Interested 1st Year UG. This talk will be very helpful for third year UG Physics majors thinking of working in experimental Quantum Computation. BTech students thinking of working in simulations and QC are welcome. Future plans include lab visits to Prof Suri’s lab (among others) and this talk is a prerequisite for that.
