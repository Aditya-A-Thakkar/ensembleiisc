Reconciling Thermodynamic Laws with statistical methods

<!--more-->

## Synopsis

The first lecture covers classical statistical mechanics, including the ensemble formalism developed by Gibbs and subsequently demonstrate it in various ensembles (e.g., microcanonical, canonical, grand canonical).

The goal in this lecture is to reconcile thermodynamic laws with statistical methods.

Concepts from probability will be included as and when needed.
